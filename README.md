# Turtle Race

A fun Python project using the `turtle` module to simulate a racing game where multiple turtles compete to reach the finish line.

## Features
- Simulates a turtle race with customizable settings.
- Uses Python's `turtle` module for simple graphics.
- Randomized movement to make each race unique.
- Interactive user experience.

## How It Works
- The user can place a bet on which turtle will win.
- The turtles move forward at a randomized pace.
- The first turtle to cross the finish line wins.
- The winner is displayed at the end of the race.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- `turtle` module
- `random` module

## Future Enhancements
- Add more interactivity (e.g., user controls to influence turtle speed).
- Implement different race modes.
- Enhance graphics for a better visual experience.
